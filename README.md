# WEMOS-Space-Game
This is a simple space game space game I programmed in C++, intended to take advantage of the Wemos LoLin32 ESP32 and it's integrated OLED display.

The microcontroller is connected to a breadboard along with 2 push buttons along with appropriate resistors. The push buttons are used as inputs to move the ship up and down. The goal is to not get hit. A video of the game and device in action can be found here: https://youtu.be/FHAhgeepw7o
